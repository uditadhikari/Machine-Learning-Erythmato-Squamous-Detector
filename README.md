# Machine-Learning-Erythmato-Squamous-Detector
The goal of the project is to make an automatic diagnosis tool for Erythemato Squamous Diseases. It should be able to classify six diseases based on 34 clinical and histopathological features. In this paper we have built three classification models namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The best model to classify the six diseases was
found to be multinomial logistic regression with mean normalization feature scaling and lambda value of 0.1. This was also the fastest algorithm that can be used to classify the six diseases.

The Dataset used for this project was from UCI Machine Learning repository. The data set can be found at the following link :
